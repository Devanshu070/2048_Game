# 2048 Game

A classic 2048 game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for GUI.

## Description

2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game where the objective is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the tile with the number 2048. Players can swipe the numbered tiles using the WASD keys of the keyboard to move them across the grid. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with a value equal to the sum of their values. The game continues until no more moves are possible (i.e., every tile on the board gets occupied) or the player achieves the 2048 tile.

In this game, players have to swipe the numbered tiles using the WASD keys of the keyboard and create a tile with the number 2048 by combining the tiles. And by combining scores get increases. Once every tile on the board gets occupied, you will lose.

## How to Play

1. Use the WASD keys on your keyboard to move the tiles.
2. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch.
3. Continue combining tiles to reach the 2048 tile.
4. Once every tile on the board gets occupied, the game ends, and the player loses.

## Key Features

- Intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for seamless interaction.
- Smooth animations and visual feedback for tile movements and combinations.
- Scoring system to track and display the player's progress throughout the game.
